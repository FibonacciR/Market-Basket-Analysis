# Instacart Market Basket Analysis - Next Product Prediction System

## Project Overview
Building a deep learning recommendation system using Instacart's real-world e-commerce data to predict what products customers will add to their cart next. This project demonstrates practical ML applications for retail optimization and personalized shopping experiences.

## Business Problem
- **Challenge**: Predicting customer purchasing behavior to improve product recommendations
- **Impact**: Increase cart value, improve user experience, and reduce shopping friction
- **Goal**: Build a system that predicts the next 5-10 products a user will likely purchase

## Dataset
- **Source**: Instacart Market Basket Analysis (Kaggle Competition)
- **Size**: 3M+ orders, 200k+ users, 50k+ products
- **Features**: Order history, reorder patterns, product sequences, time patterns
- **Target**: Predict which previously purchased products will be in user's next order

## Technical Approach
1. **EDA & Feature Engineering**: Understanding purchase patterns and creating temporal features
2. **Model Development**: Implementing collaborative filtering + sequential models (LSTM/Transformer)
3. **Evaluation**: Precision@K, Recall@K, and F1 score for recommendation quality
4. **Production Pipeline**: FastAPI endpoint + interactive dashboard
5. **Deployment**: Dockerized solution ready for cloud deployment

## Expected Outcomes
- Recommendation engine with >60% precision for top-5 products
- Real-time API serving predictions in <100ms
- Insights into customer segmentation and buying patterns
- Production-ready system demonstrating end-to-end ML engineering
